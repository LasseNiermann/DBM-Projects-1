# Welcome
This is a highly requested logging system that is going to be updated more. This logs role updates, channel updates seperating voice and text, and works with dozens of options.
You can expect a toggle system coming soon. Other than that, enjoy.

# Notes

1. This requires [DBM Mods](https://github.com/Discord-Bot-Maker-Mods/DBM-Mods/tree/master), and [DBM Beta](https://discordapp.com/channels/374961173524643843/375701228111527937/461267260234006531)
2. This logging system does not log anything with `tickets`. Instead, if you want to log your `ticket activity` and `messages`, go to these links:
[Ticket System](https://github.com/DogV2/DBM-Projects)
